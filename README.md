# Description
This project is a command-line application that generates a professional README.md file for any project. This README generator prompts the user to answer a series of questions about their project and uses their input to dynamically generate a high-quality README file. The generated README file includes a table of contents, badges, and links to important project resources such as installation instructions, usage examples, and license information. The table of contents provides an easy way for users to navigate through the document, and the badges and links help to convey important information about the project. This README generator is designed to save time and effort for developers by automating the creation of a professional README file, and ensuring that the file contains all the necessary information required to effectively communicate the purpose and functionality of the project to users.
